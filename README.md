Controller bindings for Retro-Bit's Genesis USB controller.

Note that this is using the X-Input mode, which is enabled by holding Start + B for 5 seconds. D-Input is incompatible due to using different binds.

Unsure of compatibility for the model that plugs directly into the Genesis controller port, as I do not have one on hand.
